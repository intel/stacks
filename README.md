[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/intel/stacks.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/intel/stacks)

Intel System Stacks are a set of production ready containerized reference architectures with integrated, highly-performant, open source components optimized 
for 2nd generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors. Highly-tuned and built for cloud native environments, the solution enables developers to quickly prototype
by reducing complexity associated with integrating multiple software components, while still giving users the flexibility to customize their solutions.

This open source community release is part of an effort to ensure developers have easy access to the features and functionality of Intel Platforms.
