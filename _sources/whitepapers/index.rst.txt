Identify Galaxies Using the Deep Learning Reference Stack
*********************************************************
This article describes how users can detect and classify galaxies by their morphology using image processing and computer vision algorithms. We used data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and galaxy classification from the Galaxy Zoo project, along with the Deep Learning Reference Stack, a stack designed to be highly optimized and performant with Intel® Xeon® processors.

Using AI to Help Save Lives
***************************
In health care, AI can provide insights into patient data, whether analyzing records or examining images. Despite all of the advancements in artificial intelligence, developers have been forced to do the integration across solutions and frameworks by themselves – a difficult task that distracts from the development effort. In this paper, we focus on solving two problems facing the domains of medical diagnosis and artificial intelligence.  First, we designed an AI training pipeline to detect intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), a serious condition often caused by traumatic brain injuries. ICH must be diagnosed and treated as quickly as possible to avoid disability or death of the patient. Second, we tackled the complexity of creating an AI pipeline with multiple software frameworks, configurations, and dependencies. Our solution was to use the System Stacks for Linux* OS, a purpose-built collection of containers that provide integrated, and tuned AI frameworks.

State-of-the-art BERT Fine-tune Training and Inference on 3rd Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors with the Intel Deep Learning Reference Stack
***********************************************************************************************************************************************
Driven by real-life use cases ranging from medical diagnostics to financial fraud detection, deep learning’s neural networks are growing in size and complexity as more and more data is available to be consumed. This influx of data allows for more accuracy in data scoring, which can result in better AI models, but presents challenges to compute performance. In this guide we walk through a solution to set up your infrastructure and deploy a BERT fine tune training and inference workload using the DLRS containers from Intel.
