# Deep Learning Reference Stack

The Deep Learning Reference Stack, an integrated, highly-performant open source stack optimized for Intel® Xeon® Scalable platforms. This open source community release is part of our effort to ensure AI developers have easy access to all of the features and functionality of the Intel platforms.  The Deep Learning Reference Stack is highly-tuned and built for cloud native environments. With this stack, we are enabling developers to quickly prototype by reducing the complexity associated with integrating multiple software components, while still giving users the flexibility to customize their solutions. This version includes additional components to provide greater flexibility and a more comprehensive take on the deep learning environment.

# The Deep Learning Reference Stack Release

To offer more flexibility, we are releasing multiple versions of the Deep Learning Reference Stack. All versions are built on top of the Clear Linux OS, which is optimized for IA.

> **Note:**
     The minimum validated version of Clear Linux for this stack is 31290.

## Licensing


The Deep Learning Reference Stack is guided by the same [Terms of Use](https://download.clearlinux.org/TermsOfUse.html) declared by the Clear Linux project. The Docker images are hosted on https://hub.docker.com and as with all Docker images, these likely also contain other software which may be under other licenses (such as Bash, etc. from the base distribution, along with any direct or indirect dependencies of the primary software being contained).



# Working with the Deep Learning Reference Stack


The Deep Learning Reference Stack includes TensorFlow and Kubeflow support.
These software components were selected because they are most popular/widely used by developers and CSPs. Clear Linux provides optimizations across the entire OS stack for the ultimate end user performance and is customizable to meet your unique needs. TensorFlow was selected as it is the leading deep learning and machine learning framework. Intel® Math Kernel Library for Deep Neural Networks (Intel® MKL-DNN) is an open source performance library for Deep Learning (DL) applications intended for acceleration of DL frameworks on Intel® architecture. Intel® MKL-DNN includes highly vectorized and threaded building blocks to implement convolutional neural networks (CNN) with C and C++ interfaces.  Kubeflow  is a project that provides a straightforward way to deploy simple, scalable and portable Machine Learning workflows on Kubernetes. This combination of an operating system, the deep learning framework and libraries, results in a performant deep learning software stack.

Please refer to the [Deep Learning Reference Stack guide](https://docs.01.org/clearlinux/latest/guides/stacks/dlrs.html) for detailed instructions for running the TensorFlow and Kubeflow Benchmarks on the docker images.

> **Note:**
   Although the DLRS images and dockerfiles may be modified for your needs, there are some modifications that may cause unexpected or undesirable results. For example, using the Clear Linux `swupd bundle-add` command to add packages to a Clear Linux based container may overwrite the DLRS core components. Please use care when modifying the contents of the containers. A listing of the core components can be found in the [release notes](https://github.com/intel/stacks/blob/master/dlrs/clearlinux/releasenote.md) for each release.


## Performance tuning configurations

### Single Node Configuration

| Key | Value |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| num_inter_threads | Socket number |
| num_intra_threads | Physical cores number |
| data_format       |  NHWC for Eigen; NCHW for MKL as MKL is optimized for this format |


Example: For Intel® Xeon® Gold 6140 CPU @ 2.30GHz with 2 Sockets and 18 Cores/Socket MKL training with batch size 32:

```
  python tf_cnn_benchmarks.py --device=cpu --mkl=True --nodistortions --model=resnet50 --data_format=NCHW --batch_size=32 --num_inter_threads=2 --num_intra_threads=36 --data_dir=/imagenet-TFrecord --data_name=imagenet
```
### Multi-node Configuration

The Deep Learning Reference Stack can be used in a multi node configuration using Kubernetes and different machine learning frameworks and libraries. Please refer to the System Stacks [usecases repo](https://github.com/intel/stacks-usecase) to find examples on how to setup the Deep Learning Reference Stack with Kubeflow for multi-node.
