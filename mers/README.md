## Media Reference Stack

The Media Reference Stack supports analytics and transcode workloads, built on
Intel® Xeon® Scalable Platforms and featuring software optimizations at each
layer. Customers, developers and CSPs who use this stack can gain a
significant performance boost, from hardware up through the application layer.

The Media Reference Stack is containerized software integrating industry-leading components: 

* Clear Linux* OS, an open source Linux distribution optimized for performance and security
* FFmpeg*, an open source project consisting of a vast software suite of
  libraries and programs for handling video, audio, and other multimedia files
  and streams
* GStreamer* a pipeline-based multimedia framework which links together a wide
  variety of media processing systems to complete complex workflows
* x264, an open source library and command-line utility developed for encoding video streams
* Scalable Video Technology (SVT), a software-based video coding technology
  that allows encoders to achieve, on Intel  Xeon Scalable processors, the best
  possible trade-offs between performance, latency, and visual quality: AV1 & HEVC
* Intel® OpenVINO (™) toolkit, an Open Visual Inference and Neural Network
  optimized toolkit, provides developers with improved neural network
  performance on a variety of Intel® processors and helps them further unlock
  cost-effective, real-time vision applications.

The Media Reference Stack is designed to accelerate offline and live media
processing, analytics, and inference recommendations for real-world use cases
such as smart city applications, immersive media enhancement, video
surveillance, and product placement.
